# Calulator (Lommeregner)

This calculator was made for a course at Specialisterne with the purpose of familiarizing myself with Github

## The program
When the program is run the user will be prompted with a request to enter a number.

After which it will enter a loop in which:
* You get prompted for an operation to perform: (+, -, \*, /) or the option to enter nothing and end the calculation.
* You then get prompted with another request to enter a number.
* The result of the operation will be shown.
* Loop starts over
